# 200 - Requirements

Based on "Learn how to use Docker Images on Gitpod." at https://www.gitpod.io/screencasts/using-custom-docker-images

As we will be using Gitpod to run Threagile, and Threagile has a Docker Image which can be obtained publicly, we follow the instructions how to use a custom (here: [Threagile](https://hub.docker.com/r/threagile/threagile)) Docker Image on Gitpod.
