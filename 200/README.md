# 200 - Requirements

Based on "Learn how to use Docker Images on Gitpod." at https://www.gitpod.io/screencasts/using-custom-docker-images

Based on "Name your build stages" at https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/

As we will be using Gitpod to run Threagile, and Threagile has a Docker Image which can be obtained publicly, we follow the instructions how to use a custom (here: [Threagile](https://hub.docker.com/r/threagile/threagile)) Docker Image on Gitpod.

Two files need to be added to the root of this repository:

1) .gitpod.yml

  ```
  
  ```

2) .gitpod.Dockerfile

  ```
  
  ```
