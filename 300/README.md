**Components**  

> Depicted as 8-sided polygons / octagons (type: external-entity e.g. Customer Web Client) or ellipses (type: process e.g. Load Balancer) or cilinder (type: datastore e.g. Database, Fileserver) for technical assets.

These refer to the individual systems, applications, or services that process, store, or manage data assets. 

Components can be software modules, hardware devices, or even entire platforms that contribute to the overall architecture.

**Communication Links**  

> Depicted as arrows.

These are the pathways through which data flows between components. 

They can include APIs, network connections, or any other means of transferring information, ensuring that components can interact effectively.

- **Azure Service Bus**: A messaging service for connecting different applications and services.
- **Azure API Management**: A service for creating and managing APIs, facilitating communication between components.
___

**Trust Boundaries**

> Depicted as dotted rectangles.

These define the limits within which data is considered secure and trustworthy. 

Trust boundaries help identify areas where data may be exposed to risks or threats, guiding security measures and access controls to protect sensitive information.
